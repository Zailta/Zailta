👋 I'm a passionate Backend Developer holding a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My expertise lies in the Java Stack, where I thrive on crafting robust and efficient solutions.

💡 Constantly driven by a love for programming, design, and a bit of travel, I bring an obsessive attention to detail to all my projects. Each endeavor is not just a task but an opportunity to create something exceptional.
